# Find all instances of naked twins

        # loop over units checking if there is are any naked twins

            # get all boxes with a length of two


            # now get all the naked pair twins ie exists twice in pairs


            # iterate through the naked_twins removing the values from the non naked twin boxes


                # loop over the boxes in the unit and remove the pair from them
                # we could use peers as instead but would still need the check to
                # ensure we aren't impacting the other naked twin

                    # test to ensure we don't eliminate the values from either naked-twin

                        # Eliminate the naked twins as possibilities for their peers
                        # the sorted is required for passing the test assertions as the box values
                        # are expected to be in numerical order.
